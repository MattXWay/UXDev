# UX Dev Assignment @ Carhartt by Matúš Majer

This project is for internal use as a part of the hiring process @ Carhartt. It aims to showcase basic skills in HTML/CSS when developing design of components from Figma. 

I decided to not use any libraries (bootstrap, SCSS or other) simply due to time frame [24 hrs] and the fact that in this case, plain CSS3 was sufficient. Thus, this project is only using HTML5 and CSS3 at the moment, though would likely be expanded upon and changed to angular/react if it was to be implemented to a larger scale product.

In the files, you can see that I use both IDs and classes, despite not being completely utilized in that way (especially classes). That is mainly due me "preamptively" assuming certain components to be reused multiple times within the same page (such as the copy styles - bold, alternative, etc.). I also put effort to make as many components controllable by code as possible (for example the superscript sign in the "50%").

If given more time, I would likely spend more time optimising different breakpoints and window-handling behaviour, and possibly work on more meta settings to optimise SEO. In the current state, the app is using similar-like fonts from Figma, as the ones used in the file are licensed and I was not able to quickly find them available as a family. Thus, some of the text might be looking a little different and is not pixel-perfect, as it would optimally be. 

I would also spend a bit more time on some scroll-based transitions later on, such as fade-in of individual items, or zoom after clicking on a CTA button. This however fell out of the time scope for me.
